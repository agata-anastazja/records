# Records

This is an application to view crimes committed in the Greater City of London, with their date, status and location.

I got the seed data from the police API.



To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000/crimes`](http://localhost:4000/crimes) from your browser and see the crimes!!!
